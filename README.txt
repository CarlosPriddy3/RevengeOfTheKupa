## Instructions
 - The objective is to find the cloning machine and shut it down!
 - Move around using the arrow keys or the `AWSD` keys. Jump using the `SPACE` bar. Pause by pressing `ESC`.
 - Kupa can enter into its shell and launch itself forward by holding `SHIFT` then releasing. This can stun the Mahrios momentarily, as well as destroy certain obstacles on impact.
 - Careful! The Mahrios will get quicker as you progress through the level
